          <h2>  Bio     </h2> <br>
            <p>I'm a Scottish-American industrialist, business magnate, and philanthropist. I led the expansion of the American steel industry in the late 19th century and became one of the richest Americans in history. I also became a leading philanthropist in the United States and in the British Empire. During the last 18 years of his life, I gave away about $350 million to charities, foundations, and universities â€“ almost 90 percent of his fortune. My 1889 article proclaiming "The Gospel of Wealth" called on the rich to use their wealth to improve society, and stimulated a wave of philanthropy. </p>
